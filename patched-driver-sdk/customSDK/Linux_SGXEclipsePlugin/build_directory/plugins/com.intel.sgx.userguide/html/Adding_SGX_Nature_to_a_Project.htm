        <h2>Adding SGX Nature to a Project</h2>
        <p>The <i>nature</i> of an Eclipse project is a concept defined by an Eclipse Platform which allows a plug-in to tag a project as a specific kind of project.   Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions  uses an <i>SGX nature</i> to add SGX-specific behavior to projects.  Project natures are defined by plug-ins, and are typically added or removed per-project when the user performs some action defined by the plug-in.</p>
        <p>To use Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions Eclipse Plug-in in your project, you need to add SGX nature to it.   You may either add SGX nature to a pre-existing C/C++ project or create a project with SGX nature from start.  See <a href="Adding_SGX_Nature_to_a_non_SGX_project.htm">Adding SGX Nature to a non-SGX project</a> and <a href="Creating_a_New_C_C_Project_with_SGX_Nature.htm">Creating a New C/C++ Project with SGX Nature</a> for how to complete these tasks.</p>
