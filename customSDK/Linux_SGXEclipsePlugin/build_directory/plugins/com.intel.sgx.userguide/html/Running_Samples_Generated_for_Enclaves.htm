        <h2>Running Samples Generated for Enclaves</h2>
        <p>Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions Eclipse* Plugin provides an option to generate a sample application together with the enclave code when the enclave is created.  After the project is build, the sample application is built also and ready to run.  You can see the sample application named sample in the enclave directory in Project Explorer.  You can run this sample as a local C/C++ application as shown in the following figure:</p>
